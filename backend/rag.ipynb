Our objective is to establish a robust foundation for\\nunderstanding the intricacies and potentials inherent in this symbiotic relationship.\\nAs we delve into the state of play, we aim to illuminate key theoretical underpinnings\\nand empirical insights that underpin our study of open source LLMs and Rag sys-\\ntems within the context of BIGmama Technology. To initiate this exploration, we\\ncontextualize our inquiry within the broader discourse of natural language processing\\nand information retrieval, elucidating the multifaceted challenges and opportunities\\npresented by the integration of open source LLMs and Rag systems. Subsequently,\\nwe navigate through seminal concepts and methodologies, including the principles\\nof LLM architecture, Rag framework components, and their applications in various\\ndomains. These foundational insights serve as pillars supporting our quest to explore\\nthe potential synergies and advancements offered by the convergence of open source\\nLLMs and Rag systems within the framework of BIGmama Technology.\\n1.1 Presenting BIGmama Technology\\nBIGmama is an innovative startup founded in France with a subsidiary in Algeria,\\nspecializing in data science and artificial intelligence solutions.
