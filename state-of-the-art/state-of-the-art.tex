In recent years, the remarkable advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been primarily driven by the development of LLMs. These LLMs, such as GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. However, despite their impressive performance, LLMs still face challenges in effectively retrieving and incorporating relevant context for generating accurate and coherent responses.

Enter RAG systems, a novel approach that seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional LLMs by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generation models. RAG systems combine the strengths of both retrieval and generation techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of generated text.

This chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of RAG systems, delving into their architecture, components, training processes, applications, advantages, and challenges. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of LLMs and their evolution, laying the groundwork for understanding the need for RAG systems. We then proceed to dissect the intricacies of RAG systems, discussing the role of retrieval in providing context and the role of generation in producing fluent responses.

Through detailed examination and analysis, we uncover the inner workings of RAG systems, exploring how retrieval and generation components interact within the architecture. Real-world applications and use cases of RAG systems across various domains are elucidated, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize tasks such as question answering, dialogue generation, and content creation.

Furthermore, we evaluate the advantages and limitations of RAG systems compared to traditional LLMs and other approaches in NLP. By examining performance metrics, challenges, and future directions, we gain insights into the transformative impact of RAG systems on the field of natural language processing.

In summary, this chapter serves as a comprehensive guide to RAG systems, offering readers a deep dive into one of the most promising advancements in NLP. As we navigate through the complexities and potentials of RAG systems, we pave the way for understanding their role in shaping the future of human-computer interaction and language understanding.

\section{Machine Learning}

\subsection{Definition}


Machine Learning, often abbreviated as ML, is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. In simpler terms, machine learning enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

At its core, machine learning is all about creating and implementing algorithms that facilitate these decisions and predictions. These algorithms are designed to improve their performance over time, becoming more accurate and effective as they process more data.

In traditional programming, a computer follows a set of predefined instructions to perform a task. However, in machine learning, the computer is given a set of examples (data) and a task to perform, but it's up to the computer to figure out how to accomplish the task based on the examples it's given.

For instance, if we want a computer to recognize images of cats, we don't provide it with specific instructions on what a cat looks like. Instead, we give it thousands of images of cats and let the machine learning algorithm figure out the common patterns and features that define a cat. Over time, as the algorithm processes more images, it gets better at recognizing cats, even when presented with images it has never seen before.

This ability to learn from data and improve over time makes machine learning incredibly powerful and versatile. It's the driving force behind many of the technological advancements we see today, from voice assistants and recommendation systems to self-driving cars and predictive analytics \cite{datacamp:ml}.

\subsection{Relationships to other fields}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses the field of computer science dedicated to creating systems capable of emulating human-like intelligence, problem-solving, and decision-making. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI focused on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Within ML, Deep Learning stands out as a subfield that employs neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex representations of data, particularly effective in tasks like image and speech recognition. ML and Deep Learning are integral components of AI, providing the framework for developing intelligent systems capable of learning, reasoning, and adapting to new information, thereby advancing the capabilities of AI across various domains.

\subsection{Limitations of Machine Learning: Challenges and Considerations}

Although machine learning is a powerful technique for extracting knowledge from data, it also has certain limitations that are important to consider:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Data dependency:} Machine learning heavily relies on the quality and quantity of training data. If the data is poorly labeled or unrepresentative, it can lead to errors in predictions.}
    \item{\textbf{Overfitting:} When the model is too complex compared to the training data, it can overfit and not generalize well to test data. This can also result in poor performance for new data.}
    \item{\textbf{Explainability:} Machine learning models can be very complex and difficult to understand. It can be challenging to understand how the model makes decisions and to explain these decisions to users.}
    \item{\textbf{Biased data:} Training data can be biased due to factors such as data selection, human biases, or measurement errors. This can lead to biased predictions for test data.}
    \item{\textbf{Lack of diversity:} Machine learning models may lack diversity in the types of data they can handle. For example, machine learning models may struggle to process unstructured data such as images, sounds, and texts.}
    \item{\textbf{Computational cost:} Machine learning algorithms may require high computational power and significant storage resources to process large amounts of data. This can be costly and time-consuming to train and implement models.}
\end{itemize}


\section{Deep Learning}

\subsection{Definition}

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that teaches computers to perform tasks by learning from examples, much like humans do. Imagine teaching a computer to recognize cats: instead of telling it to look for whiskers, ears, and a tail, you show it thousands of pictures of cats. The computer finds the common patterns all by itself and learns how to identify a cat. This is the essence of deep learning.

In technical terms, deep learning uses something called "neural networks," which are inspired by the human brain. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information. The more layers, the "deeper" the network, allowing it to learn more complex features and perform more sophisticated tasks \cite{datacamp:dl}.


\subsection{Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning}

Deep learning stands apart from traditional machine learning in its approach to data and learning methods.
Machine learning algorithms typically rely on structured, labeled data for predictions, where specific features are defined and organized into tables.
While machine learning can handle unstructured data, it often requires preprocessing to structure it. In contrast, deep learning streamlines this process by directly processing unstructured data such as text and images. It automates feature extraction, reducing reliance on human experts. For instance, in categorizing pet photos, deep learning algorithms autonomously identify key features, like ears, crucial for distinguishing between animals. In contrast, machine learning requires manual feature hierarchy establishment by human experts.

\subsection{Deep Learning Applications}

Deep learning has a wide range of applications across various domains due to its ability to learn complex patterns from large volumes of data. Some of the different types of applications for deep learning include:

\subsubsection*{Image Recognition and Computer Vision:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Deep learning is extensively used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, facial recognition, and image segmentation.
    \item Applications include self-driving cars, medical image analysis, surveillance systems, and augmented reality.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Natural Language Processing (NLP):}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Deep learning is employed for understanding and generating human language, enabling tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, text summarization, and chatbots.
    \item Applications include virtual assistants, language translation services, social media sentiment analysis, and customer support chatbots.
\end{itemize}


These are just a few examples of the diverse applications of deep learning, demonstrating its versatility and impact across various industries and fields.

\subsubsection*{Pre-Transformer Era}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Eliza (1964-1966):} One of the earliest NLP programs, Eliza was a simple chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, designed to mimic a Rogerian psychotherapist. It used pattern matching and substitution to generate responses, laying the foundation for future conversational AI systems.
    \item \textbf{Statistical language models (1980s-2000s):} Statistical language models, such as n-grams, were developed to predict the probability of a word in a sequence based on the preceding words. These models were widely used in tasks like speech recognition and machine translation but struggled with capturing long-range dependencies in text.
    \item \textbf{Neural language models (2003-2013):} Neural language models, such as feedforward and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), emerged as an alternative to statistical models. Bengio et al. (2003) introduced a feedforward neural network for language modeling, while Mikolov et al. (2010) popularized RNN-based models with the release of the RNNLM toolkit.
    \item \textbf{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (1997-2014):} Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) introduced LSTMs as a solution to the vanishing gradient problem faced by RNNs. LSTMs were later used in sequence-to-sequence models for tasks like machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014) and formed the basis for several LLMs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Transformer Era}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Attention is All You Need (2017) \cite{vaswani2023attention}:} Vaswani et al. introduced the transformer architecture, which replaced the recurrent layers in traditional models with self-attention mechanisms. This breakthrough enabled the development of more powerful and efficient LLMs, laying the foundation for GPT, BERT, and T5.
    \item \textbf{GPT (2018) \cite{openai:gpt}:} OpenAI released the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a unidirectional transformer model pre-trained on a large corpus of text. GPT showcased impressive language generation capabilities and marked the beginning of a new era of LLMs.
    \item \textbf{BERT (2018) \cite{devlin2019bert}:} Google introduced the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which used a masked language modeling objective to enable bidirectional context representation. BERT achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP tasks, revolutionizing the field.
    \item \textbf{GPT-2 (2019) \cite{radford2019language}} OpenAI released GPT-2, a significantly larger and more powerful version of the original GPT. GPT-2 demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, generating coherent and contextually relevant text with minimal prompting.
    \item \textbf{T5 (2019) \cite{raffel2023exploring}:} Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) adopted a unified text-to-text framework for pre-training and fine-tuning, allowing it to be used for various NLP tasks by simply rephrasing the input and output as text. T5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
    \item \textbf{GPT-3 (2020) \cite{brown2020language}:} OpenAI unveiled GPT-3, an even larger and more advanced version of the GPT series, with 175 billion parameters. GPT-3's performance on various NLP tasks with minimal fine-tuning raised questions about the capabilities and potential risks associated with LLMs.
\end{enumerate}

The history of large language models is marked by continuous innovation and progress in the field of natural language processing. As we move forward, LLMs are expected to grow in size, capability, and efficiency, enabling more complex and human-like language understanding and generation. However, the development of these models also brings forth ethical and practical challenges that must be addressed, such as biases, misuse, and computational resource requirements. It is essential for researchers and practitioners to balance the potential benefits of LLMs with their limitations and risks, fostering responsible development and use of these powerful tools.

\subsection{Neural networks}

Neural Networks (NNs) are computational models composed of layers of neurons that can learn from data. They are versatile and robust models capable of learning directly from raw data, without the need for manually selected features. NNs employ a training algorithm known as backpropagation, which adjusts the model's parameters based on a loss function.

\subsubsection*{Feedforward networks}

A feedforward neural network is characterized by its architecture, devoid of cycles, where the output of layer \(i\) can be computed using the outputs from layer \(i - 1\). The architecture of a neural network encompasses its structure, including the number of hidden layers and neurons, as well as the functions employed for computations. These selections, known as hyperparameters, are parameters whose values are not determined by the learning algorithm. Figure \ref{fig:ffn} shows a typical feedforward network architecture.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=6cm,keepaspectratio=true]{ffn.png}
    \caption{
        \it{Example of a feedforward neural network architecture. The network has an
            input layer with four neurons, one hidden layer with three neurons and an output layer
            with a single neuron}
    }
    \label{fig:ffn}
\end{figure}

As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ffn}, neural networks comprise an input layer, \(n\) hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the data that the network needs to process, which then traverses through the hidden layers before reaching the output layer. The output layer provides the model's result for the given input data. When a neural network contains multiple hidden layers, it qualifies as a deep neural network (DNN) and falls within the domain of deep learning \cite{oshea2015introduction}. Each layer consists of \(i\) neurons, with connections between each neuron in a layer and every neuron in the previous layer, except for the input layer.

Neurons serve as fundamental computational units and, as previously indicated, establish connections with all neurons in the preceding layer. Each connection is characterized by a numerical parameter referred to as a weight.
