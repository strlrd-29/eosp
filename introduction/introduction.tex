Business Intelligence (BI) has always been about creating new insight for business by converting data into meaning that can be shared between people to drive change in the organization. One key aspect of creating meaning is to have a common shared understanding of information also known as Semantics.

Classic BI and even the newer Agile Visualization tools focus much of their selling features on attractive and unique visualizations. Preparing data for those visualizations however still remains the far most challenging task in most BI projects large and small. The ultimate goal of BI is to facilitate efficient decisions while eliminating some of the IT headache. Traditionally, BI approaches have been controlled by a centralized version of truth with a wall between IT and the business. Self-service data provisioning aims at removing this wall by providing dataset discovery, acquisition and integration techniques intuitively to the end user.
