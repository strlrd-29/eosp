\subsection{Retrieval Grader}

    prompt = PromptTemplate(
        template="""<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|> You are a grader assessing relevance 
        of a retrieved document to a user question. If the document contains keywords related to the user question, 
        grade it as relevant. It does not need to be a stringent test. The goal is to filter out erroneous retrievals. \n
        Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no' score to indicate whether the document is relevant to the question. \n
        Provide the binary score as a JSON with a single key 'score' and no premable or explanation.

        Here is the retrieved document: \n\n {document} \n\n

\subsection{Answer Generation}

\subsection{Hallucination Grader}

    prompt = PromptTemplate(

Give a binary 'yes' or 'no' score to indicate whether the answer is grounded in / supported by a set of facts. Provide the binary score as a JSON with a  single key 'score' and no preamble or explanation. Make sure to exactly output a json with one key 'score' <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
        Here are the facts:
        \n ------- \n
        {documents} 
        \n ------- \n
        Here is the answer you need to grade and don't forget, the output needs to be in json format with one and only one key called score (yes if the answer is grouned to the facts else no): {generation}  <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>""",

        in the question related to these topics. Otherwise, use web-search. Give a binary choice 'web_search' 
        or 'vectorstore' based on the question. Return the a JSON with a single key 'datasource' and
